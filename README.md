# My Personal Dotfiles

## Requirements

- `git`
- `bash` (comes by default in most systems)

## Replication

** Run the following command to replicate these dotfiles in your machine:
```sh
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r3nanp/my-dotfiles/main/install-dotfiles.sh | /bin/bash
```

This management approach wasn't created by me. [Durdn previously made a post about it](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles).
